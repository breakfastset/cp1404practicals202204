numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2]

# Write Python expressions (in the same Python file) to achieve the following:
#
#     Change the first element of numbers to "ten" (the string, not the number 10)
#     Change the last element of numbers to 1
#     Get all the elements from numbers except the first two (slice)
#     Check if 9 is an element of numbers
